# KansoMIDI
## A open-source cross-platform MIDI player optimized for Black MIDI playback.

Definitely not the fastest MIDI player to date, but this was made in an attempt to enhance my skills at coding in Rust.

## How to build & run
1. Ensure you have rust installed on your system.
2. Download the source code.
3. Open the folder in a terminal.
4. Run `cargo run --release`.

Alternatively, Windows users can download the executable from the releases page.
